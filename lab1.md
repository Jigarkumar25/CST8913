# Cloud Migration Plan – Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust


## 1. Motivators for Migration:
CNTW NHS Foundation Trust migrated to Microsoft Teams, Surface devices, and Microsoft 365 for several reasons, which are:
- Reduce travel costs and time (staff traveled 4 million miles annually)
- Maintain service continuity during COVID-19 lockdowns
- Enable remote work and virtual patient care
- Improve collaboration across 7000+ staff over 4800 square miles

## 2. Questions to Understand Infrastructure:
To determine their infrastructure, I would ask some questions, which are:
- What legacy systems are currently in use for patient records and scheduling?
- Are there any on-premises data centers or hybrid cloud setups?
- What are the current security and compliance requirements?
- How is network connectivity managed across remote locations?
- What type of devices and operating systems are used by staff?
